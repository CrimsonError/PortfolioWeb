      <h1>Hi! I'm CrimsonError, but you can call me Crimson.</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Crimson and I'm typically pretty talky and extroverted! I am an intermediate programmer and
        work as an advanced environmental artist.
        I regularly play PC games in my free time, particularly Roblox and a mix of other dystopian genres (Fallout,
        Half Life
        2, etc.), and hanging
        around with my friends.
        <br>
        <br>
        I am very morally against the use of AI generating images, code, or videos; instead supporting individual human
        creativity, as AI often steals from creators without permission while scraping the web and internet as a whole.
        <br>
        <br>
        Besides just gaming and designing, I love playing the Saxophone (Alto) and listening to Jazz or Synth depending
        on
        my mood. I love meeting new people
        and getting friends, so please don't be afraid to reach out! If you are curious about my interests, you can
        reach me using the contact tab! (I don't bite :3)
