                <h1>Hi! I'm CrimsonError, but you can call me Crimson.</h1>
                <p>
                    🌸 Hi! My name is Crimson and I go by he/they. I'm typically
                    pretty talky and extroverted, and I am an intermediate
                    programmer and work as an advanced environmental artist
                    within the Source Engine. I regularly play PC games in my
                    free time, work on environmental builds, and hang around
                    with my friends. 🌸
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    🐉 Besides just gaming and designing, I love playing the
                    Alto Saxophone and listening to Jazz or Synth depending on
                    my mood. I love meeting new people and getting friends, so
                    please don't be afraid to reach out! If you are curious
                    about my interests, you can reach me using the contact
                    tab!!!! :3 ✨
