      <h3>
        Hi! I am CrimsonError, but you can just call me Crimson. I'm just an avid programmer and game developer with
        contributions to numerous game projects and just simple programs for helping me with some daily needs ~ also
        with a mix of other skills here and there. As of 2025, I have been in the field for 6 years and haved worked on
        numerous public/private projects---from Discord bots with advanced features, to simple encryption programs. I
        also have a huge interest in the Cyber Security world, specifically penetration testing and malware analysis. If
        you would like to contact me, feel free to email crimson@crimsonerror.com. I can also commission Roblox/Source
        Engine esc. projects through a form of payment or if I am personally interested---however I only stick to jobs
        like an Environmental Artist, Mapper, or any other building/designing roles.
